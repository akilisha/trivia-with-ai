Iâ€™d like to create a trivia game engine with a sleek, modern-look, highly polished, capacitor-based, mobile (progressive web) frontend. One of the main ideas to to have is a player community-oriented app for bringing together people, family and friends. The trivia game can have any combination of the following 6 categories of characteristics detailed below (plus a seventh cross-cutting features category), one from each category, and they should all be configurable by the person creating a game.

A. Progression mode:
1. Manual - this is like a student taking a test, or a person filling a survey or questionnaire,
2. Automatic - this is the case where questions come through in a timed manner without ability to pause
3. SemiAuto - this is the case where the next question only comes through when all the last player in the session submits their response. This works well when there is a shared channel, like a chat, to prompt everyone to finish in case they are taking too long, or the organizer can simply remove them from the game room. A good example is like estimation for sprint planning in scrum

B. Answer feedback:
1. No answers are shown through the entirety of the game - this again is like a student taking an exam
2. Show answer after question - users gets to see what the answer is after each question

C. Points available
1. None - like surveys
2. Set by organizer for the question
3. Bet/Wager by player - they can only wager upto how many points they have

D. Points Scoring
1. All or nothing - you either get it right and get all the points or get it wrong and no points
2. Countdown - the points decrease during the period allocated for answering. The countdown times starts a few seconds after the question is shown to give the user time to read the question
3. Close but not over - applies only when answers are numeric. For response above correct answer, you score nothing. For response below 10 times (can be configured) the answer, you score nothing. For response in the correct range, the points scores are proportional to distance close to the real answer
4. Bad choices have consequences - negative (points lost) for wrong anwser

E. Multiple choices
1. Has multiple choices with no clues. Applies only to automatic progression mode. During the clock countdown, the cues are either
   - introduced progressively or
   -  wiped out progressively
2. Has multiple choices with no clues.
3. Has no multiple choices
4. Question has no specific answer - free flow in nature, like a questionnaire or survey

F. Delivery mode
1. One question with one answer
2. Top ordered items in a given criteria
3. Match left hand side items with corresponding right hand side items
   - non-pictorial
   - pictorial
4. Pick odd one out - pointing out the odd items is the way to score

G. Cross-cutting features
1. add bonus round option
2. include streak bonus points
3. add double points round
4. 

The trivia game app should allow:
1. Player registration
   - profile management
   - account deletion
   - user preferences
2. View player trivia history with scores
3. View player score rank in trivia community, and top ranking software community members
4. create game and:
   - invite friends or participant
   - remove joined player
5. View latest games added that match:
   - their geographic preference
   - their social circle
   - a category of questions

To create a trivia game, the game owner will do the following:
1. configure the game characteristics - chose one from each category (A to F) but feature category (G) is cross-cutting so they can choose one or more (or even all) from this category alone
2. configure how many rounds the game should have
3. Configure how many questions each round will have
4. For each question, pick a category from the list of question categories provided by the game engine
5. For each question, decide each of the following attributes, if it is applicable:
    - how many points
    - duration to show each question (applies only for automatic progression)
    - duration between questions
    - duration between rounds of questions
6. Schedule a date in the future

The game engine will source trivia questions from a variety of places, including and not limited to
- list of questions provided by the game creator - this list must match the expected format so that it can be parsed and loaded into the game - these will NOT be stored n the database
- database of questions
- game question APIs
- generative AI - these will be stored in the database of questions for future use
- real time online scanning/searching (like for new related questions or current events) - these will also be stored in the database for future use as well

The available game categories are:
- biology
- physics
- chemistry
- mathematics
- history
- geography
- folklore and mythology
- english language
- current events
- tv &movies
- music and arts
- general knowledge

Design summary - action plan

Roya Trivia Game: Architectural & Feature Design Summary
Date: July 20, 2025

I. Core Vision & Principles
Multiplayer Real-time Trivia Platform: Enable hosts to create highly customizable trivia games with unique characteristics and foster a community feel among players within a game.

Iterative & Agile Development: Build incrementally on a stable foundation.

Scalable Architecture: Design for extensibility, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

II. Key Architectural Decisions
Hybrid UI Approach (Phaser + Web UI):

Phaser.js Canvas: Dedicated for core game rendering (questions, answers, timers, in-game effects).

Standard Web UI (HTML/CSS/JS, potentially React later): For non-game elements like lobby, chat modal, scoreboards, configuration forms, player profiles, administrative features. This allows for modern, responsive, and accessible UI development decoupled from game rendering.

Server Authority & Real-time Communication:

Node.js (Express): Serves static files and acts as the backend application server.

Socket.IO: Primary communication protocol for real-time, bi-directional events between server and clients. All game state and actions flow through Socket.IO.

Server as Source of Truth: Game state, scores, current question, timers, and game rules are managed and validated exclusively on the server (gameRooms object).

Authentication & User Data (OAuth & PaaS):

No Credential Storage: The application will not store user passwords or handle direct user registration.

OAuth Provider Integration: User authentication will be delegated entirely to a third-party OAuth provider (e.g., Auth0, Firebase Auth). Your backend will only verify tokens provided by the OAuth service.

User Preferences & Game Data in Your DB: Only non-PII user preferences and game-specific data (game history, scores, potentially selected question sets) will be stored in your own database, linked by the OAuth provider's unique user ID.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) for Preferences: Exploration of a dedicated PaaS solution for user preferences to offload management.

Database Strategy:

Required: A database will be necessary for:

User preferences (linked to OAuth user ID).

Game history (who played, final score, game config).

Leaderboards (derived from game history).

Curated/Pre-defined Question Bank (if not just from files/APIs).

Questions generated by AI/real-time scanning (for future use).

Not for: User credentials.

Robust Messaging Protocol & Decoupling:

Event-Driven Architecture: All client-server interactions are explicit Socket.IO events.

Server-Side Event Routing: A central handler will map incoming Socket.IO events to dedicated business logic functions (e.g., handleCreateGame, handleSubmitAnswer), decoupling event reception from core game logic.

Clear Payloads: Messages will have well-defined structures (messageType, sender, payload).

Rate Limiting: Essential server-side protection against spam/abuse for all critical events (chatMessage, submitAnswer, startGame, kickPlayer).

III. Core Game Flow (High-Level)
Game Creation: A host defines a gameTitle and configures specific game characteristics by selecting one feature from each of the primary categories (A-F) and any number of cross-cutting modifiers (G). They also define basic game parameters (rounds, questions per round, points, durations).

Game Join: Players join a specific game instance using a unique roomId (via shareable link or QR code). Games are invitational-only (no public listing of player-created games).

Lobby: Players wait in a pre-game lobby, can chat (per-game, ephemeral chat), and the host can manage players (kick).

Game Play: Questions are presented, players submit answers based on the game's characteristics.

Results & Progression: Rounds conclude, results are shown (or not, based on config), and the game progresses to the next question/round or ends.

Game End: Final scores are displayed. Game state is cleaned up.

IV. Game Characteristics (Configurable by Host)
These define the "5 dimensions of uniqueness" for each game. All settings for a game instance will be stored in gameRooms[roomId].config.

A. Progression Mode: (Determines how questions advance)

Manual: Host explicitly advances.

Automatic: Timed progression.

SemiAuto: Advances when all active players answer, or host override.

B. Answer Feedback: (Determines visibility of correct answers)

No Feedback: Answers never shown during game.

Show Answer After Question: Correct answer revealed per round.

C. Points Available: (How points are assigned to questions)

None: Survey/quiz mode.

Organizer Set: Host pre-defines points per question.

Bet/Wager: Players bet points they have (requires client UI for wagering, server-side validation).

D. Points Scoring: (How points are awarded/deducted)

All or Nothing: Full points for correct, zero for wrong. (Current default)

Countdown: Points decrease over question duration.

Close but not over (Numeric): Proportional points for answers within a defined range (requires numeric question type).

Bad Choices Have Consequences: Negative points for wrong answers.

E. Multiple Choices: (Presentation & input for answers)

Progressive Clues: MC with cues revealed/wiped during countdown (visual, tied to Automatic progression).

No Clues: Standard MC. (Current default)

No Multiple Choices: Free-form text input (e.g., Fill-in-the-blank).

No Specific Answer: Free-flow text (survey).

F. Delivery Mode: (Structure of the question and expected response)

One Question, One Answer: Standard. (Current default)

Top Ordered Items: Player submits an ordered list of items (e.g., "Top 5 deepest lakes").

Match Items: Match left-hand items to right-hand items (pictorial/non-pictorial).

Pick Odd One Out: Identify the outlier from a set of choices.

Cross-Cutting Note: Delivery Mode also explicitly supports pictorial/audio media as part of the question presentation.

G. Cross-Cutting Modifiers (Optional - Host Can Select Multiple):

Bonus Round Option: Specific rounds with different rules.

Streak Bonus Points: Rewards for consecutive correct answers.

Double Points Round: Specific rounds where points are multiplied.

V. App Features & User Flows
Player Management:

OAuth-based registration/login (no local credentials).

User preferences (stored in your DB/PaaS).

Account deletion (via OAuth provider flow).

No PII storage by your application.

Game Invitation & Joining:

Invitational-Only Custom Games: No public room list.

Joining Methods: roomId via direct input, shareable link (with deep linking), QR code scanning.

Host Controls: Host can remove (kickPlayer) unwanted participants.

In-Game Chat:

Ephemeral: Chat messages are not persisted beyond the game session.

Per-Game: Chat only within the context of a specific game room.

Floating/Toggable Modal: Independent UI from Phaser canvas.

Private Messages: Players can send direct messages to other players in the room.

Server-Side Rate Limiting: For all chat messages.

Game Creation (Host Workflow):

Configure 1 feature from each category A-F, and any from G.

Set number of rounds, questions per round.

Define question attributes (points, durations) if applicable.

(Future) Pick question categories per question.

(Future) Schedule game date/time.

Question Sourcing:

Host-provided JSON list (not stored in DB).

Database of questions (for engine-provided/generated questions).

External Game Question APIs.

Generative AI (stored to DB).

Real-time online scanning (stored to DB).

Administrative / Reporting Features (Not User-Facing for Player-Created Games):

"View Latest Games" (admin-only report, not a public marketplace).

Player trivia history, score rank, top members (requires database).
